# belugas

Hello and welcome to my beluga epigenetic clock file repository. 

This folder contains the code I used to build the Cook Inlet beluga epigenetic clock presented in this paper: 

Bors EK, Baker CS, Wade PR, O'Neill KB, Shelden KEW, Thompson MJ, Fei Z, Jarman S, and Horvath S (2021). An epigenetic clock to estimate the age of living beluga whales. Evol Appl. https://doi.org/10.1111/ eva.13176



The files include: 

(1) Notebook for determinig sex correlations 
(2) Notebook for determining single CpG correlations with sex 
(3) R Project for building clocks using glmnet()
(4) Notebook that evalutes, plots, and provides stats for each clock built in R and runs the clock on biopsy samples to determine age of living whales
